This is the website for the online textbook **"Orchestrating Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics Analysis with Bioconductor" (OSTA)**.

This book describes the steps in a computational analysis pipeline for **spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT)** data, using the [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) framework and R programming language. The analysis pipeline is built up as a series of steps, each described in a chapter, with complete examples and workflows using R code and datasets that can be run on your own laptop.

The book is organized into several parts, consisting of (i) introduction, (ii) preprocessing steps to prepare data for R, (iii) analysis steps, (iv) complete workflows, and (v) appendix.

Additional details on analysis steps, as well as additional introductory material on R and Bioconductor, can be found in the related textbook [Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor (OSCA)](https://osca.bioconductor.org/).
