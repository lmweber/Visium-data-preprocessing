# Introduction

This book provides interactive examples of computational analysis workflows for spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data using the [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) framework within the R programming language.


## Contents of this book

The chapters are organized into several parts:

- **Introduction:** introduction, background on SRT, and R/Bioconductor object classes

- **Analysis steps:** chapters describing individual analysis steps

- **Workflows:** chapters containing complete workflows for several example datasets

- **Visium preprocessing:** appendix on detailed preprocessing steps for 10x Genomics Visium data

- **Appendix:** related resources, contributors and acknowledgments, and references


## Who this book is for

This book is intended for readers who have some experience with R, but does not assume familiarity with Bioconductor. The examples and workflows include all R code required to download data, set up data objects, perform analyses, and visualize results.

For readers who are new to R and Bioconductor, additional useful resources include:

- The [Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor (OSCA)](https://osca.bioconductor.org/) book [@Amezquita2020], which contains additional introductory material on R and Bioconductor, as well as comprehensive materials on analysis workflows for single-cell data.

- The [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) online book provides an excellent introduction to R.

- [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) and [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) provide online lesson materials on R programming, the Unix shell, and version control.

- The R/Bioconductor Data Science Team at LIBD has a [detailed guide](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/rbioconductor-data-science-bootcamps.html) of free resources and videos to learn more about R and Bioconductor, as well as [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/LeonardoColladoTorres/playlists) and [LIBD rstats club sessions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1is8dZSd0FZ9Qi1Zvq1uRhm-P1McnJRd_zxdAfCRoMfA/edit?usp=sharing), including some on the basics of Bioconductor and infrastructure for storing gene expression data.


## Bioconductor

[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) is an **open source** and **open development** project, providing a cohesive and flexible framework for analyzing high-throughput genomic data in R [@Huber2015]. The Bioconductor project consists of around 2,000 contributed R packages, as well as core infrastructure maintained by the Bioconductor Core Team, providing a rich analysis environment for users.

One of the main advantages of Bioconductor is the modularity and open development philosophy. R packages are contributed by numerous research groups, with the Bioconductor Core Team coordinating the overall project and maintaining core infrastructure, build testing, and development guidelines. A key feature is that contributed packages use consistent data structures, such as [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleCellExperiment) and [SpatialExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SpatialExperiment), enabling users to integrate packages into analysis workflows. Bioconductor packages also include comprehensive documentation, including vignettes containing longer examples or tutorials.

This modular and open development approach allows data analysts to build analysis workflows that integrate the latest state-of-the-art methods developed by research groups around the world. Any research group can contribute new packages to Bioconductor by following the contribution guidelines provided on the [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) website.


## Contributions

We welcome suggestions for updates to the analysis chapters and workflow chapters in OSTA, including suggestions for new methods to include. Suggestions may be provided as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/lmweber/OSTA-book/issues). All methods included in OSTA should be available as R packages from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) or [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), which ensures compatibility with the existing workflows, ease of installation, and provides users with guarantees regarding long-term availability, stability, and maintenance via the regular build-testing, checks, and maintenance checks provided by Bioconductor and CRAN. We may also describe some methods available as packages from GitHub within the analysis chapters, but these methods will not be integrated into the interactive code examples. Methods available as `pip` installable Python packages will be integrated into the examples in future updates of OSTA using [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/).
