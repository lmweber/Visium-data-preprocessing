# Software

This book would not be possible without an immense list of software and methods contributed by the open source R and Bioconductor communities. 

```{r OSTA_dependencies}
options(width = 120)
pkgs <- installed.packages()[, "Package"]
sessioninfo::session_info(pkgs, include_base = TRUE)
```

The GitHub Actions workflow used in this book is based on [`biocthis`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/biocthis) and is made possible thanks to the [Bioconductor docker images](http://bioconductor.org/help/docker/).
